# Tetris Android Game

A modern Tetris game built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose for Android.

## Features

- **Classic Tetris Gameplay**: All 7 standard Tetromino pieces (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L)
- **Modern UI**: Built with Jetpack Compose for smooth animations and responsive design
- **Level Progression**: Automatic level advancement with increasing speed
- **Score System**: Points awarded for line clearing (40, 100, 300, 1200 for 1-4 lines)
- **Responsive Layout**: Optimized for mobile devices with compact controls
- **Game States**: Play, Pause, Game Over, and Level Start animations

## Game Controls

- **←** : Move piece left
- **→** : Move piece right  
- **↻** : Rotate piece
- **Drop** : Instantly drop piece to bottom
- **Pause/Play** : Toggle game pause

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

- **GameManager**: Manages game state, logic, and StateFlow emissions
- **GameBoard**: Handles board state, piece placement, and line clearing
- **Tetromino**: Represents game pieces with rotation and positioning
- **UI Components**: Compose-based UI with reactive state management

### Key Features

- **StateFlow Integration**: Reactive UI updates using Kotlin StateFlow
- **Deep Copy Pattern**: Ensures proper state updates for UI reactivity
- **Modular Design**: Separated game logic from UI presentation
- **Debug Support**: Comprehensive logging for development

## Build Requirements

- Android Studio Arctic Fox or later
- Kotlin 1.9.0+
- Android SDK 35
- Gradle 8.7+

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Open in Android Studio
3. Sync Gradle files
